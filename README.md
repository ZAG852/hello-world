# hello-world
This is a practice repository to get me to get me through and see how its done
My name is Zach and I grew up in a fairly small town where I have been and avid 
outdoorsman who loves camping, hiking and things of that nature. I have actually 
just recently discovered programming and Ihave been working hard to learn as much
as I can about it. I have learned at least a basiclevel of C++ and I'm currently
working on learning a couple more programming languages and some more advanced
programming techniques as well. I've really wanted to get into the technical side of game
development and I have been working steadily towards that goal for the past 6 months.
I am still currentlygoing to school for software engineering/computer science and
I have loved it so far. This seems to be a goodamount of basic knowledge about me
for now and I will come out with projects in the future. hopefully I can keep a
fair amount of work flow going when I'm on my breaks as well as in school due to lots of stuff 
I'm wanting to experiment with especially as I learn more about this site and programming itself
which was actually recommend by a friend.
